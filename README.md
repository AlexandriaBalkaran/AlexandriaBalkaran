## Hey there 👋

Sales and Marketing expert turned Software Engineer!

After an exciting journey in Sales and Marketing, I’ve decided to switch gears and dive headfirst into the world of Software Engineering! 🚀 

I’m combining my passion for tech with a strong foundation in business to build something truly amazing in the tech world.

Looking forward to connecting and working on new projects.

 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my personal project Pour Decisions - a happy hour finder for Toronto.
